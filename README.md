# Yon B. My Showcase Portfolio


## Description

- This site served as my first project building a website from the ground up. I tried to apply as many concepts 
as possible within the given time also keeping a homogeneus style and easy read.

- It will also serve as a hub for future projects and a lab of sorts to experiment with new concepts.

- My main focus during this project was to get a better understanding of web design, responsiveness and how sites are shown to the viewer on different screen sizes.
