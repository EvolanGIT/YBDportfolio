            Hello! My name is <span data-descr="Hire Me!">Yonatan Bermudez.</span> 
            This website is designed to showcase my work while I learn about web design. 
            This will also display links to all my work while I progress and become more proficient 
            in this line of work. Even when this is just my first code work all by myself, I will continue
            improving this with every tool I would like to practice more with. <br><br> I am fluent in Spanish and English and enjoy playing Rugby. 
            I'm also an Anime and gaming fan who would like to design apps and mobile games 
            as well as websites for all kind of content for the gaming industry. I am part of a small group of friends who all decided to learn 
            together and we call ourselves "The four codesmen".
            <br><br>
            Thanks for checking out my portfolio!
